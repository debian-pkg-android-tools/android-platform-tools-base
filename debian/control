Description: base tools for developing applications for the Android system
 This package includes various tools for developing and building Android
 applications, e.g.
 .
  * Draw 9-patch: Allows you to easily create a NinePatch graphic using a
    WYSIWYG editor. It also previews stretched versions of the image, and
    highlights the area in which content is allowed.
 .
  * Lint: Android Lint is a tool that scans Android projects for potential
    bugs.
 .
  * Android plugin for Gradle: The Android build system consists of an Android
    plugin for Gradle.  You can build your Android apps from within Android
    Studio and from the command line on your machine or on machines where
    Android Studio is not installed (such as continuous integration servers).
 .
  * Various Java libraries used by Android SDK.

Description: Android Plugin for Gradle
 The Android build system uses the Android Plugin for Gradle to support building
 Android applications with the Gradle build toolkit. The plugin runs independent
 of Android Studio so the plugin and the Gradle build system can be updated
 independently of Android Studio. You can build your Android applications from
 within Android Studio or from the command line on your machine or on machines
 where Android Studio is not installed (such as continuous integration servers).
 .
 This package does not include gradle-experimental.jar because its dependencies
 are hard to resolve in Debian.
 .
 To build an Android application using the plugin in Debian, add a Maven
 repository with a URL "file:///usr/share/maven-repo", and change the plugin
 classpath to "com.android.tools.build:gradle:debian".
